# Deep-Recs
Deep-Recs uses a simple 2-layer neural network to learn latent embeddings for users and items, using implicit feedback data. The network takes a user's full history of implicit signals as input and tries to predict their recent history (~2 weeks) as output. I'll add a fuller description and a comparison with other methods (IMF, Logistic-MF, word2vec) later when I have the time.
